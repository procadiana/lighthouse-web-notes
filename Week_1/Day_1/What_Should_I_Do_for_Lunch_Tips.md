### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows

```javascript

function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("I don't know what to do!");
  if (hungry === true) {
    if (availableTime < 20){
      console.log("Eat in the Lab or in the kitchen");
    }
    else if(availableTime >= 20 && availableTime <= 30){
      console.log("You deserve a break and could try a place in Gastown");
    }
    else if(availableTime > 30) {
      console.log("This is a bootcamp after all and you should probably reconsider");
    }
  }
  else if (hungry === false){
    console.log("I'm not hungry");
  }
}
```
